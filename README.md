Automaton - a movement puzzle
=============================
####Entry for mini Ludum Dare #49, theme: Non-human player

Move around the map and get to the flag, but try not to repeat your keystrokes while doing so! The simple mechanic is heavily inspired by some commonly used features in Vim. When I use Vim, I often find myself otimizing for the least number of keystrokes to accomplish any given task. In automaton, you issue movement commands to a bot, and you can use repeat modifiers (E.G: 30â†’ to move right 30 times), record your actions, and play them back.
